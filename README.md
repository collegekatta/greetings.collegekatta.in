## Features

Our project is currently focused on the frontend and does not involve the creation of a database for data storage. However, we have plans to expand the feature set in the future, which includes:

- A user-friendly form for adding and managing details.
- The ability to generate and share personalized wishes simply by opening a URL.

We are dedicated to continuously enhancing the project with exciting features in the future. Since this is an open-source project, we encourage both contributions and suggestions from the community to help shape its development. Your ideas and input are highly valued as we strive to make this project even better.
